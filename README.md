# CharacterAuctionCode

## Summary

This code is a snippet from my AniQuest discord bot game, meant to show an understanding of parsing data, using custom filters, and displaying data in an organizied way.

## Basic System

This code works by referencing a character database with all existing characters, only selecting characters marked for sale, then displaying that to the user in a paginator allowing them to easily scroll through it. Multiple filters are also availible to the player that allow them to filter by character, a certain stat, etc.

## Purpose 
This code is meant to demonstrate an understanding of database implementation in projects, as well as the ability to mold that data into user desired inputs with a great length of variety.
